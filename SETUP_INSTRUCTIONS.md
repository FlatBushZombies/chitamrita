# Setup Instructions for Follow Feature

## Issue Fixed
The error `HTTP 404` in the follow functionality has been fixed by switching from a non-existent REST API to the proper Supabase implementation.

## What Was Wrong
The app was trying to use a REST API at `https://chitamrita-backend.vercel.app/api/follow` which doesn't exist, causing 404 errors.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Updated SupabaseContext**: Now imports `followService` from `lib/supabase.ts` instead of `lib/follow-service.ts`
2. **Added Configuration Checks**: The Supabase service now checks if environment variables are properly set
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages for different failure scenarios
4. **Removed Hardcoded URLs**: No longer uses hardcoded API endpoints

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Set up Supabase Project
1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Get your project URL and anon key from the project settings

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root with:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Set up Database
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL script from `supabase-setup.sql` to create the follows table

### 4. Test the Feature
1. Start your app
2. Navigate to the Search screen
3. Try following/unfollowing users
4. Check the console for any configuration warnings

## Current Status
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ Proper Supabase integration
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ⚠️ Needs Supabase project setup
- ⚠️ Needs environment variables configuration

## Error Messages You Might See
- **"Supabase is not configured"**: Set up your environment variables
- **"Follow feature not available yet"**: The backend API doesn't exist (fixed)
- **"Network error"**: Check your internet connection
- **"Authentication error"**: You need to log in again

The follow functionality should now work properly once Supabase is configured!
